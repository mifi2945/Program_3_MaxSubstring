# Program_3_MaxSubstring

- [X] A paragraph describing the approach you will use to solve the problem. Provide at least 2 illustrations that explain the approach.
- [X] High-level pseudocode for an algorithm that uses that rule to solve the computational problem for any input
- [X] An explanation and justification for why your algorithm is correct (1-3 paragraphs)
- [X] A table of your test cases, the answers you expect, and the answers returned by your implementation of the algorithm.
- [X] An analysis of the asymptotic runtime of your algorithm, using techniques from this class.
- [X] A table and graph from benchmarking different lists with different sizes and values of m and n. Implement a brute-force solution and benchmark your implementation against it. If the benchmarks do not support your theoretically-derived run time and/or do not provide evidence that the run time of your algorithm grows more slowly than the brute-force approach, this may indicate a flaw in your implementation.
- [X] An appendix containing all of your source code and test cases
